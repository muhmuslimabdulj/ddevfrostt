## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [`muhmuslimabdulj`](https://github.com/muhmuslimabdulj)
## A passionate programmer from the largest archipelago country in the world ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©

### Actually this is my second Github account, my first Github account was [MMuslimAbdulJ](https://github.com/MMuslimAbdulJ) which now I can no longer access because I have lost all my access credentials for that account (2FA and recovery code), I know it feels quite sad for me because on that account there are several projects I made from when I learned programming to the last project I made before.
### With this new Github account I hope to be able to embark on my new programming journey. I will fork some repos from my old Github account as a legacy from my old self.
